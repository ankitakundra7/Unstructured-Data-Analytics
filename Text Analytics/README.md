# Analytics for Unstructured Data: Group Assignment #1

In this assignment you have been hired as an analytics consultant by JD power and Associates, who 
wants to perform a competitive analysis of the entry level luxury car market in the USA. Your job is to 
give advice/insights to these individuals based on the analysis of social media conversations. The 
detailed tasks are described below. 

1. Write a scraper to fetch messages posted in Edmunds.com discussion forums. The scraper 
output should be a .csv file with the following columns: date and message (even though you will 
only use the messages in your analysis). Before you develop the scraper, carefully study one of 
the forums on Edmunds.com to understand the html as well as the threading structures. 

2.  Fetch around 5000 posts about cars from the Entry Level Luxury forum 
https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/2864/general/x/entry-level-luxury-performance-
sedans
The idea is to have multiple brands and models being discussed without one of them being the 
focal point. You can choose early or recent posts (do mention what you have chosen). Note that 
Edmunds changed its forum structure a few years ago, but left the early posts with the old 
structure. So you should choose either the oldest or newest posts. 

Task A: Once you fetch the data, test if the data support Zipfâ€™s law. Plot the most common 100 words in 
the data against the theoretical prediction of the law. For this question, do not remove stopwords. Also 
do not perform stemming or lemmatization. 
Hint: Check http://www.garysieling.com/blog/exploring-zipfs-law-with-python-nltk-scipy-and-matplotlib 

Task B: Find the top 10 brands from frequency counts. You will need to write a script to count the 
frequencies of words (stopwords should NOT be counted). Replace frequently occurring car models with 
brands so that from now on you have to deal with only brands and not models. You will need another 
script for this job. A list of model and brand names (not exhaustive) are provided in a separate file.  

Task C: Calculate lift ratios for associations between the top-10 brands identified in Task A. You will have 
to write a script to do this task). For lift calculations, be sure not to count a mention more than once 
per post, even if it is mentioned multiple times in the post.

Task D: Show the brands on a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) map (use a Python script for MDS, there 
are multiple scripts available on GitHub). 

Task E: What insights can you offer to your client from your analyses in Tasks C and D
